# Ideas

The main idea is too use Home Assistant to start automating some of the things at home.

Initial required setup:

1. Should allow to control the different lights from a single division, later replicated to the entire house
1. Should allow to control the itensity of a light
1. Should allow to control the blinds
1. Should allow to use the regular switches at home
1. Should allow to control the sound and where it's enabled

# Doubts to clarify

1. How should we prepare the electric instalation to support this in the future, use a domotic panel that contains the devices
1. Do we need any specific lights to have dimmable lights
1. How do we control the sound speakers from HomeAssistant, how should I leave the instalation prepared?
1. Should I have any special attentionts on the switchs that are now being isntalled to later support this?

# Hardware 

Wich hardware should I buy to start testing this different devices?
